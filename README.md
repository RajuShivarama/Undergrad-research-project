This is my final year Graduation Project Conducted on the computational fluid analysis of the Journal bearing using MAT-LAB programming.

Project Objective :- To reduce the vibrations in the journal bearing through effective damping by placing the perforted shims between the journal and the bearing.

Technologies Used:- Matlab-Programming, Differential-calculus, statistics, Straight-lines, computational fluid dynamics.
